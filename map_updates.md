Star Map Structure

Galaxy Nodes: The map is built as a network of nodes (star systems) connected by lanes. Each node can be:

Colonizable star (habitable planet)

Resource-rich system

Strategic chokepoint (only connection between regions)

Special/Ancient site

Clusters: Groups of systems form clusters, similar to Mass Effect’s nebula regions, creating a sense of larger “territories.”

Connections: Instead of full free movement, travel is limited to lane-based jumps (like Stellaris), making positioning and control of systems important.

System Level View

Entering a node zooms into a simplified planetary system:

Star in the center

Up to 3–5 orbiting planets/moons

Planets can be colonizable, mined, or have anomalies
